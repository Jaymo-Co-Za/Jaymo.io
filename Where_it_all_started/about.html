			Welcome to Jaymo.co.za, South Africa’s most loved fashion lifestyle resource! A place to access student lifestyle and fashion related entertainment at an affordable prices! <br><br>
			Jaymo.co.za founded it’s routes on bringing fashion at an affordable price point to South Africa’s masses through retail and resale methods. With rising unemployment rates 
			in South Africa, the Corporation expanded the scope of it’s work, in the pursuit of  creating circular economies within South Africa’s informal business sector. The company
 			creates self-employment opportunities, through reviving South Africa’s now immobile clothing manufacturing industry, all whilst taking advantage of latent hard skills within
 			the South African population.
			<br><br>
			South Africa’s education system has seen various changes over the last 20 years, with one example being the removal of practical subjects such as woodwork or the example of particular
			 interest to,  Jaymo, the skill of Needlework. Many, older generation women, who are in need of employment opportunities have a skill that can meet the demand of producing goods, however
			 have no way of connecting themselves to a market.
			<br><br>
			Jaymo.co.za is an online market, whereby customers can select a design of their liking, specify the colour and size of the desired garment and have it made to specification, delivered to their doorstep. 
			These jobs are then sent to the seamstress, who then fulfils the order, which is then collected from the seamstress and delivered to the customer. This sees the removal of retail stores
			 from the supply and value chains who apply significant markups to cover costs and generate profits, leaving less room for the exploitation of employees and high costs to consumers.
			The fashion industry  has been found guilty for contributing significantly to issues relating to waste, pollution and global warming. Jaymo.co.za aims at keeping production to the
			 needs of the consumer, fulfilling demand at the request of the consumer, leaving no room for wasteful production.
