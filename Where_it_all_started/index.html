        Welcome to Jaymo.co.za! This domain was purchased as a "stress purchase" whilst the owner was stressing about final year end examinations, along with a Yoco machine (that was on sale).
        Development related to this domain have all become part of a learning exercise to compliment the domain owner's field of study - Information Systems; In conjuction to work related requirements, e.g., the owner has no social media accounts and decided to create mockups thereof to signal both there personality and their skills. University courses often bring too
        little real world application and development of IT related skills, and this domain stands as a tool to help bridge that gap.
