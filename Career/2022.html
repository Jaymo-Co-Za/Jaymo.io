<!-- I am writing this code the way I need it to be done
    
    I believe that anything that you need to do in life has to be founded in a good amount of meaningful content with a purpose.
    This means that if we are going to be put out there, it needs to be drawn out a good, meaningful information around
    something that has meaning.
    Putting it on a website or building an application around it should come last.   

    So I will write everything that needs to be written, Until I feel like there is enough meaning in it.
    The approach will follow one that is similiar to video creating and editing - after taking copious amounts of footage, I
    only remove what I need to bring about the best vido - meaning that there is never "too much" content.
    Then we can decide on what the format is going to look like.
